# 🧩 Shaco Tool (soon : All-in-One Tool)

Shaco Tool is a desktop utility designed for the Transformice game community.
Right now, it's in active development and mainly handles downloading and modifying language files — a handy feature for managing translations and customizing in-game text.

#### Future Plans

This is just the beginning! The goal is to turn Shaco Tool into a true all-in-one toolkit for Transformice. Planned features include:

- Editing and managing image assets

- Working with SWF files

This tool is built using:

- **Vue 3**
- **TypeScript**
- **[Tauri](https://tauri.app/)** – for building a lightweight desktop application

## 🚧 Note on Code Quality

The code is currently focused on **functionality first**. It's not fully cleaned up or organized yet, but improvements and refactoring are coming soon!

## 🤝 Contributions

Contributions are **very welcome**!  
Feel free to open issues, suggest ideas, or submit pull requests — whether it's bug fixes, refactoring, or adding features.

Let's make it better together! 🙌

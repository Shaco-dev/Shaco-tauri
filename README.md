# 🧩 Shaco Tool (soon: All-in-One Tool)

Shaco Tool is a desktop utility designed for the Transformice game community.  
Right now, it's in active development and mainly handles downloading and modifying language files — a handy feature for managing translations and customizing in-game text.

## 🚀 Future Plans

This is just the beginning! The goal is to turn Shaco Tool into a true all-in-one toolkit for Transformice. Planned features include:

- Editing and managing image assets
- Working with SWF files

## 🚧 Note on Code Quality

The code is currently focused on **functionality first**. It's not fully cleaned up or organized yet, but improvements and refactoring are coming soon!

This tool is built using:

- **Vue 3**
- **TypeScript**
- **[Tauri](https://tauri.app/)** – for building a lightweight desktop application
